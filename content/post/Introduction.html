<p>Welcome! I am a recent PhD graduate and aspiring Data Scientist, based in Cambridge, UK.</p>
<p>A bit about me - I completed my PhD in Statistics and Operational Research at the <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/">STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training</a>, looking at a variety of areas in time-series forecasting, including linking forecasts to inventory management, hierarchical forecasting, and modelling multiple seasonalities and calendar effects (like Christmas/Bank Holidays) in a retail setting. You can find my thesis <a href="https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/143845/1/2020wallerphd.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Most recently, I’ve been working as a Postdoctoral Research Assistant on the <a href="https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=102613">LHOFT project</a>, a collaboration between a number of Universities and industrial partners to predict/optimise freight routes between the UK and destinations abroad, with a particular focus on the north of England. I really enjoyed this role, particularly as it involved drawing multiple datasets from different sources together and allowed to apply a range of knowledge from Stats and OR, for example combining current trends in forecasting with good old linear programming.</p>
<p>When I’m not working, I like to mess around on the piano (mainly jazz) and most sports. I also enjoy playing chess, where I am currently graded 2208 by the <a href="https://www.englishchess.org.uk/">ECF</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! Feel free to email me at danielsimonwaller[at]gmail[dot]com. I’m also on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-waller-7471a9141/">LinkedIn</a>. However, I’m not on Twitter. Sorry about that.</p>
